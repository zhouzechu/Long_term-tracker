# Long_term-tracker
## Test
You can track your videos after typing in the config file /experiments/siamfcpp/test/[otb/got]/siamfcpp_googlenet-[got/otb].yaml
```python
python main/test.py --config /experiments/siamfcpp/test/[otb/got]/siamfcpp_googlenet-[got/otb].yaml
```

## Train
You can train the model after typing in the config file /experiments/siamfcpp/train/got-10k/siamfcpp_googlenet-trn.yaml
```python
python main/train.py --config /experiments/siamfcpp/train/got-10k/siamfcpp_googlenet-trn.yaml
```
You'd better to use the tracking net for training.
